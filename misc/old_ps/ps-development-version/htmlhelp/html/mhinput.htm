<P><A NAME="Mantel-Haenszel Input"></A><B>Input variables on the <i>Mantel-Haenszel</i> dialog box</B></P>

<P><B>&alpha; </B><br>
The Type I error probability for a two sided test of the null hypothesis that the true within-stratum odds ratio equals 1.  This is the probability that we will falsely reject the null hypothesis.</P>
<P><B>power</B><br>
The probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis that the within-stratum (adjusted) odds ratio equals 1. </P>
<P><B><I>n</I></B><br>
The total number of cases in all strata.</P>
<P><B><I>T</I></B><br>
The number of strata (tables).</P>
<P><B>&psi;</B><br>
The within-stratum (adjusted) odds ratio of exposure in cases relative to controls. This odds ratio also equals the odds ratio for disease in exposed subjects relative to unexposed subjects.  It approximates the within-stratum (adjusted) relative risk in case-control studies when the disease is rare in the general population.</P>

<P><A NAME="mhtable"></A><B>Input Tables</B></P>

<P>Enter the proportion of cases in each table.  The sum of these
proportions must equal one.  For each table enter the number of controls per case
and the proportion of
exposed controls that you anticipate in you study.
For example, suppose there will be T = 2 strata with subjects divided as follows:</P>
<p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>Table 1</td>
    <td>Cases</td>
    <td>Controls</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exposed</td>
    <td>?</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unexposed</td>
    <td>?</td>
    <td>?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total</td>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>40</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>Table 2</td>
    <td>Cases</td>
    <td>Controls</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exposed</td>
    <td>?</td>
    <td>30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unexposed</td>
    <td>?</td>
    <td>?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total</td>
    <td>80</td>
    <td>40</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>Then the total number of cases is n = 20+80 = 100.  The table required by the PS program will be as follows:</p>
<p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>Table</td>
    <td>Proportion of<br>Cases in the<br>ith table</td>
    <td>Number of<br>controls<br>per case</td>
    <td>Proportion<br>of controls<br>exposed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0.2</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>0.25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>0.8</td>
    <td>0.5</td>
    <td>0.75</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Our notation is consistent with the other PS modules but is different from that
used by Wittes and Wallenstein (1987).  In their notation N is the total number of
cases and controls.  In the first row of Table 2 of their paper we have n=160
cases while they have N=400 case-control subjects. The following table shows
the input needed to do these calculations.  &rho;<sub>i</sub>&lambda;<sub>i</sub>
and &pi;<sub>i2</sub> are defined as in Wittes and Wallenstein (1987).
</p>

<p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>Table</td>
    <td>Proportion of<br>Cases in the<br>ith table</td>
    <td>Number of<br>controls<br>per case</td>
    <td>Proportion<br>of controls<br>exposed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>&rho;<sub>1</sub>&lambda;<sub>1</sub>N/n = 0.125</td>
    <td>(1-&rho;<sub>1</sub>)/&rho;<sub>1</sub> = 4</td>
    <td>&pi;<sub>12</sub> = .2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>&rho;<sub>2</sub>&lambda;<sub>2</sub>N/n = 0.375</td>
    <td>(1-&rho;<sub>2</sub>)/&rho;<sub>2</sub> = .667</td>
    <td>&pi;<sub>22</sub> = .4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>&rho;<sub>3</sub>&lambda;<sub>3</sub>N/n = 0.5</td>
    <td>(1-&rho;<sub>3</sub>)/&rho;<sub>3</sub> = 1.5</td>
    <td>&pi;<sub>32</sub> = .65</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
Select an uncorrected test statistic and let &alpha;=0.05, n=160, T=3, and &psi;=2.  Then the input in the previous table gives a power estimate of .85 which agrees
with Equation (3.2) of Wittes and Wallenstein (1987).  (See their
Table 2, row 1, column 8.)
