<P>Survival Studies -- Evaluating independent cohorts using the log-rank test.  The approach of <A HREF="pshe23av.htm#ref8">Schoenfeld and Richter (1982)</A> is used.  The user may specify the ratio of the number of patients in the cohorts being compared.  In survival studies the response from each patient consists of a dichotomous fate variable and a follow-up interval.  The fate variable indicates the patient's status at the end of her follow-up. </P>

<P>The <I>Survival</I> dialog box has four sections: <A HREF="pshe0y44.htm">Output</A>, <A HREF="pshe71gu.htm">Design</A>, <A HREF="pshe4c6s.htm">Input</A>, and Description.</P>

<P>Each null hypothesis is tested with respect to a two-sided alternative hypothesis.</P>
