<P>Sample size and power calculations for studies involving linear regression.   This module is for studies involving two independent linear regressions and you wish to compare the slopes or intercepts of these regression lines.  The values of the independent (<I>x</I>) variables of the regression lines may either be specified by the investigator or determined observationally when the study is performed.  In the latter case, the investigator must estimate the standard deviation of the independent variables.</P>

<P>The <I>Regression 2</I> dialog box has four sections: <A HREF="pshe7nzo.htm">Output</A>, <A HREF="pshe3rce.htm">Design</A>, <A HREF="pshe8nuc.htm">Input</A>, and Description.</P>

<P>Each null hypothesis is tested with respect to a two-sided alternative hypothesis.</P>
