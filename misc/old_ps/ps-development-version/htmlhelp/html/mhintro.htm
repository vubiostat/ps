<P>Suppose that study subjects are either cases or controls and are either exposed or not exposed to some risk factor.  These subjects are stratified by some confounding variable into T distinct strata.  For each statum we have a separate 2x2 contingency table for cases and controls who are or are not exposed.  We postulate that the within stratum odds-ratio for disease in exposed versus unexposed subjects is constant across strata. This is the odds-ratio for disease associated with exposure that is adjusted for the confounding variable that defines the strata.  The null hypothesis of the Mantel-Haenszel test is that this adjusted odds ratio equals 1.  We use <A HREF="pshe23av.htm#ref9">Wittes and Wallenstein's (1987)</A> method for sample size and power calculations for this test.</P>

<P>Each null hypothesis is tested with respect to a two-sided alternative hypothesis.</P>
