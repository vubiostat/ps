<P><B>Investigator chooses treatment levels?</B></P>

<P>Select <I>yes</I><B> </B>if the independent variables of the linear regressions will take distinct values that are known in advance of the conduct of the study.  In this case the program will prompt you for the number of levels and the values of these levels. </P>

<P>Select <I>no</I> if the independent variables are observed characteristics of the patient (e.g. body weight).  You will have to estimate the standard deviation of this independent variable for both the experimental and control treatments.  For normally distributed data 95% of a sample will lie within plus or minus 2 standard deviations of the mean. </P>

<P><B><A NAME="lr2example1"></A>Example:</B>  You might wish to assess some response of patients receiving either 50, 100, or 200 mg of treatment drug per day.  In this case you must tell the program that there will be 3 treatment levels whose values are 50, 100, and 200 respectively.  You will also need to state whether equal numbers of patients will receive each treatment level or specify the proportion of patients who will receive each level.</P>

<P><B>How is &sigma; obtained?</B></P>

<P>The parameters &sigma;, &lambda;<sub>1</sub>, &sigma;<sub>x<sub>1</sub></sub>, &sigma;<sub>y<sub>1</sub></sub>
and &rho;<sub>1</sub> are all interrelated (see <A HREF="pshe23av.htm#ref4">Dupont and
Plummer 1998</A>).   You may estimate &sigma; directly.  However, you may also
estimate &sigma; indirectly by entering estimates of one of the following
sets of parameters from pilot data.  </P>

<P>&sigma;<sub>x<sub>1</sub></sub>, &sigma;<sub>y<sub>1</sub></sub> and &lambda;<sub>1</sub></P>

<P>&sigma;<sub>x<sub>1</sub></sub>, &rho;<sub>1</sub> and &lambda;<sub>1</sub> </P>

<P>It is important that the preceding all come from the same pilot data.  The values of
&sigma;, &lambda;<sub>1</sub>, &sigma;<sub>x<sub>1</sub></sub>, &sigma;<sub>y<sub>1</sub></sub>
and &rho;<sub>1</sub> used to estimate &sigma; need not be the same as the values of
these statistics for your planned study.</P>

<P>&lambda;<sub>1</sub> is the slope estimate in the control group.</P>

<P>&sigma;<sub>x<sub>1</sub></sub> is the standard deviation of the independent variable for the control subjects.</P>

<P>&sigma;<sub>y<sub>1</sub></sub> is the standard deviation of the dependent variable in the control group.</P>

<P>&rho;<sub>1</sub> is the correlation coefficient between the dependent and independent variables for the control subjects.</P>

<P><B>What do you want to compare?</B></P>

<P>Select</P>

<P><I>Slopes</I> if you wish to compare the slopes of the regression lines or</P>

<P><I>Intercepts</I> if you wish to compare the values of the intercepts of the regression lines with their respective dependent (<I>y</I>) axes.</P>
